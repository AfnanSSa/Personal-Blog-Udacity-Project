                    <p>
                        <br>Every year, I recommend the best books out of the hundreds that have crossed my desk in
                        my work as book critic. These are the books I can’t stop thinking about months after
                        I’ve read them, the books I’ve pressed on my friends along with demands that they tell me all
                        their thoughts and especially let me know if they burst out laughing/burst into tears/threw
                        the book across the room at that one part.

                        In this batch: An action-packed allegory of the failures of America’s prison system. A
                        philosophical literary biography about the paradoxes of marriage. A surprising amount of
                        excellent historical fiction, a trend I’m choosing to blame on Hilary Mantel. Domestic novels
                        and satire and an extended tribute to Nabokov.

                    <p>
                        Let’s get into it. In no order but alphabetical, here are the 13 best books from the second half
                        of 2023.<br>

                        <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Chain-Gang All-Stars</span> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chain-Gang All-Stars takes place in a near-future US where prisoners have the option of leaving
                        jail to fight
                        to the death in nationally televised gladiatorial games. If they live through three years on the
                        circuit, the
                        prisoners are free, sentence served. Almost no one ever lives that long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Across three acts in this taut novel, Adjei-Brenyah kaleidoscopes into the minds of people at
                        all levels of complicity
                        and victimization from the Chain-Gang All-Stars fights. A white spectator goes from justifying
                        her fascination with the
                        games as cultural anthropology to rooting for the villains to get their throats cut. A prisoner
                        tortured in solitary confinement
                        opts for the circuit over another day at the mercy of his brutal guards. A board member working
                        for a private prison company strategizes
                        the best way to increase audience investment in the games. And two veteran fighters struggle to
                        find love and forgiveness within their
                        brutal, bloody world.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glossing the text with periodic footnotes, Adjei-Brenyah makes it clear that the atrocities of
                        his world are only slightly removed from the
                        atrocities of our own. His most admirable characters declare that they are opposed not just to
                        the Chain-Gang All-Stars fights but to the
                        whole system: the games, the death penalty, and the prisons themselves. They dare us to ask
                        whether we can be so brave.

                        <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Loved and Missed</span> by Susie Boyt
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loved and Missed, the seventh book by UK author Susie Boyt and her first to be published in the
                        US,
                        is a deceptively simple novel. On a first read through, this tale of a grandmother building a
                        life
                        with her granddaughter is so charming that you almost don’t notice how technically difficult the
                        book is.
                        It is hard to write a book that is warm without being sentimental. Yet Loved and Missed is full
                        of heart
                        but never saccharine; it is warm, and it shows you the effort and strain it takes to become so
                        warm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ruth, prone to sardonic observations yet also deeply earnest, is the narrator of this slight
                        book. She’s a
                        part-time schoolteacher and a single mother. At school she is a triumph — her students have been
                        known to
                        call her “Mum” — but her own daughter, Eleanor, ran away from home at 15. As the novel opens,
                        the pair are
                        partially estranged, and Eleanor is addicted to drugs. Ruth, desperate to care for someone who
                        will have to
                        love her back and certain that Eleanor is incapable of caring for anyone, more or less kidnaps
                        Eleanor’s daughter,
                        Lily, to come and live with her.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The domestic routine between Ruth and Lily fills this novel with its pleasing cozy rhythms. “It
                        was so civilized,” Ruth marvels,
                        recounting the ritual of their days. “The evenings settled on us gently and we read our books
                        side by side on the sofa, a saucer
                        of biscuits balanced on a cushion, until six, when we put the television on.” The pleasure of
                        this small-scale household bliss
                        is all the more intense because we know how hard-won it is, and how easily it can be disrupted.
